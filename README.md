# Mario
It is a game designed in C language. The game is similar to mario.

Things I have worked on:
	1.Movement of character.
	2.Obstructions in movements.
	3.Jumping*

Things to be worked on:
	1.The whole game is written in a single file, its needs to be segmented.
	2.Building Enimies-the one which when mario touches, dies.
	3.An architecture of game- levels.
